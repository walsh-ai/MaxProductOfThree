A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The product of triplet (P, Q, R) equates to A[P] * A[Q] * A[R] (0 <= P < Q < R < N) 

Produce a solution that will find the maximal value of any possible triplet Q, P, R for the array. 
* Not required to give the values P, Q, R giving a maximal product, but the value of the maximal product possible.
